# FetchiOSCodingChallenge
Thank you for taking the time in reviewing my attempt at the Fetch iOS Coding Challenge. I had a lot of fun putting my best foot forward towards this effort and I hope you see some of my thought process in the code. Unfortnately after I implemented the image in multiple ways, including as a UIImageView as was required I recevied many errors that after some troubleshooting/Googling, I found to be the fault of the machine I am working on.

The Mac I'm currently using does not have the newest MacOS which led me to fall behind on XCode updates.

Ideally I would be using the latest version of XCode because it would provide more features and stability, for example I was unable to use AsyncImage which is why my networking has 2 calls as opposed to 1.

Here was my resulting error that led me to finish the project to the best of my abilities.

Unfortunately you won't be seeing my most polished or possibly even functional work. I would love to still get the opportunity to continue in the hiring process with further conversation if that is at all possible. Again, I am so thankful for you taking the time to review my code. Have a great rest of your day.
