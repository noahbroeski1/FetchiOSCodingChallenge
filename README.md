# FetchiOSCodingChallenge
Thank you for taking the time to review my submission for the Fetch iOS Coding Challenge. I had a lot of fun putting my best foot forward in this effort, and I hope you see some of my thought process reflected in the code. 
</br>
Throughout this challenge I tried to implement the thumbnails as UIImageViews in multiple ways. These ways included, ___. After multiple attempts and troubleshooting, I believe the machine I am working on may have something to do with the errors I'm receiving.

The MacBook Air I'm currently using does not have the newest MacOS which led me to fall behind on XCode updates.

Ideally I would be using the latest version of XCode because it would provide more features and stability, for example I was unable to use AsyncImage which is why my networking has 2 calls as opposed to 1.

Here was my resulting error that led me to finish the project to the best of my abilities.

Unfortunately you won't be seeing my most polished or possibly even functional work. I would love to still get the opportunity to continue in the hiring process with further conversation if that is at all possible. Again, I am so thankful for you taking the time to review my code. Have a great rest of your day.
