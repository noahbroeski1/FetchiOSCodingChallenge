# FetchiOSCodingChallenge
Thank you for taking the time to review my submission for the Fetch iOS Coding Challenge. I had a lot of fun putting my best foot forward in this effort, and I hope you see some of my thought process reflected in the code. 
</br>
</br>
Throughout this challenge, I tried to implement the thumbnails as UIImageViews in multiple ways. These ways included, ___. After multiple attempts and troubleshooting, I believe the machine I am working on may have something to do with the errors I'm receiving. 
</br>

As shown below, the MacBook Air I'm using for this challenge does not have support for the latest MacOS, which led me to fall behind on Xcode updates.

Ideally, I would use the latest version of Xcode to complete this challenge. Using this version would provide more features and stability. For example, the latest version of Swift has a function called AsyncImage. If I had the latest version, I would have chosen this route as opposed to creating a unique row object. Instead I did create this unique row object, which may increase user latency but I believe it was the best approach given the situation.

Here was my resulting error that led me to finish the project to the best of my abilities.

Unfortunately you won't be seeing my most polished or possibly even functional work. I would love to still get the opportunity to continue in the hiring process with further conversation if that is at all possible. Again, I am so thankful for you taking the time to review my code. Have a great rest of your day.
