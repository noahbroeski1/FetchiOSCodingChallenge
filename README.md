# FetchiOSCodingChallenge
Thank you for taking the time to review my submission for the Fetch iOS Coding Challenge. I had a lot of fun putting my best foot forward in this effort, and I hope you see some of my thought process reflected in the code. 
</br>
</br>
Throughout this challenge, I tried to implement the thumbnails as UIImageViews in multiple ways. These ways included, ___. When trying to implement these ways of loading images concurrently as UIImageViews, I ran into errors similar to the one seen below.

</br>
After multiple attempts and troubleshooting, I believe the machine I am working on may have something to do with the errors I'm receiving. 
</br>

As shown below, the MacBook Air I'm using for this challenge does not have support for the latest MacOS, which led me to fall behind on Xcode updates.

Ideally, I would use the latest version of Xcode to complete this challenge. Using this version would provide more features and stability. For example, the latest version of Swift has a function called AsyncImage, which would be my ideal method of loading images. Instead, I created a unique row object, which may increase user latency but is an effective workaround given the lack of the AsyncImage function.

Despite the issues I had with my machine and its lack of up to date software, I believe my solution is a great implementation of the required work presented by the challenge. I would love to have the opportunity to continue on in the hiring process with further conversation about my past work and what I can bring to Fetch. Again, I am so thankful for you taking the time to review my code. Have a great rest of your day.
